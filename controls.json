      "4-summary": "Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity technology that focuses on monitoring and responding to suspicious activities and threats on endpoints, such as desktops, laptops, servers, and mobile devices. EDR solutions continuously collect and analyze endpoint data, including process behavior, file activity, network connections, and system events, to detect indicators of compromise (IOCs) and potential security breaches. By providing real-time visibility and advanced threat detection capabilities, EDR helps organizations quickly identify and mitigate security incidents, enhancing overall endpoint security posture and reducing the risk of data breaches.",

      "5-summary": "SOAR, or Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response, is a cybersecurity approach that integrates security orchestration and automation capabilities with incident response processes. It enables organizations to streamline and automate repetitive security tasks, such as alert triage, investigation, and response, by orchestrating workflows across disparate security tools and systems. By automating routine tasks and standardizing incident response procedures, SOAR platforms help security teams improve efficiency, reduce response times, and better manage the increasing volume and complexity of security alerts and incidents.",

      "6-summary": "Threat Intelligence Platform Integration involves the incorporation of external threat intelligence feeds and data sources into an organization's security infrastructure and processes. This integration enables security teams to enhance their threat detection and response capabilities by leveraging up-to-date information about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). By integrating threat intelligence feeds with security tools such as SIEMs, EDR solutions, and SOAR platforms, organizations can enrich their security telemetry, automate threat detection and analysis, and prioritize and remediate security incidents more effectively.",

      "7-summary": "APT Detection and Response refers to the strategies, technologies, and processes used to identify and mitigate Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), which are sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks typically orchestrated by well-funded and organized threat actors. APT detection involves leveraging advanced threat detection techniques, such as behavioral analytics, anomaly detection, and threat intelligence, to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with APT activity. APT response encompasses the coordinated efforts to contain, investigate, and remediate APT attacks, often involving incident response teams, threat hunters, and security technologies such as EDR, SIEM, and SOAR platforms, to minimize the impact and prevent further infiltration by the threat actor.",

      "8-summary": "Purple teaming is a collaborative security testing approach that brings together the red team (attackers) and blue team (defenders) to simulate realistic cyber attack scenarios and evaluate an organization's security posture. Unlike traditional red team engagements, which focus solely on simulating attacks, purple teaming involves close coordination between the red and blue teams throughout the testing process. This enables organizations to identify weaknesses in their security controls, improve detection and response capabilities, and enhance overall resilience against cyber threats by fostering communication, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement between offensive and defensive security teams.",
